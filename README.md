# BLM
Welcome to the movement ! 
Here we will be doing multiple programs to aid in the movement. 
Attached our first two programs will allow you to sign multiple petitions.

## Requirements:

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
  
Using Selenieum: 
We have already included selenium into each of the folders however, you will need to pip install it into your computer. 
Then you will need to download your version of selenium to your computer and run the .exe when your run the python file. 

Check the version of chrome you have because it will effect the type of selenium you download. 

Link to download Chromedriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 

## Running the script:

On Terminal (if you are on a Mac) or Powershell/Command Prompt, run:  
`python main.py`  

## Bugs:
### Mac: 
Bug--> Directory bug File or path may not be found will be fixed in coming update. 

### Edge case: 
If you have found yourself needing to use a different chrome please download the .exe and drag it into the folder of the mac/windows script this will ensure that the path is created.
