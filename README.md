# BLM
Welcome to the movement ! 
Here we will be doing multiple programs to aid in the movement. 
Attached our first two programs will allow you to sign multiple petitions.

Using selenieum: 
We have already included selenium into each of the folders however, you will need to pip install it into your computer. 
Then you will need to download your version of selenium to your computer and run the .exe when your run the python file. 

Check the version of chrome you have because it will effec the type of selenium you download. 

Link to download selenium: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads 

Most of us are on 8:3 but check!! also if thats the case you might need to delete the .exe we put in the folder. GO TO EDGE CASE.

Mac: 
Bug--> Directory bug File or path may not be found will be fixed in coming update. 

Edge case: 
If you have found yourself needing to use a different chrome please download the .exe and drag it into the folder of the mac/windows script this will ensure that the path is created. 

ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO RUN .EXE otherwise it will not work. 



MORE projects to come for the movement so keep a look out :) Thank you. Credit will also be coming too.
